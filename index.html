    <h3>About Omen</h3>
    <p>
        Omen is a phantom of a man with mysterious origins and many names. He has a limited memory of his past, though he does remember being involved in something that caused him to be ripped apart and killed. All he knows that links to who he used to be is a place known as Point Light, a past friendship with Sabine "Viper" Callas, and feelings of restoration with every kill he makes. Contributing to the formation of the VALORANT Protocol, Omen would go on to become its third recruit and serve as one of its more experienced agents, all while he continues his search for answers about what truly happened to him over a decade ago.
